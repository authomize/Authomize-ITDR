# Open Solutions
This area will contain solutions that provide value to developers and companies trying to find solutions to managing thier IAM infrastructure by collecting information and data from Authomize. We expect two see two types of integrations in this area:

- **Connectors:** these pull identity and application data from one system and inject it into Authomize through the API
- **Incident processing:** These applications or middleware in some cases pull Incidents from Authomize and make it generally available for use or          consumption by other tools.



This location will contain customer and authomize created integrations.
