This is an area only for partner inegrations. Partners should request to deploy. The structure here will need to be different I think as we want Partners to own there own Folder structure.
An example might be the following:
    1) CISCO
        *) Unbrella Integration
        *) Firewall Integration
        *) Fabric Integration
